# BNTA Assessment Centre - Demo Notes

High-level notes for people delivering content at an assessment centre. The aim of the session is to build a small web page with header, main and footer. Header will include title and nav bar, main will have an image and three posts, footer will have a copyright notice. Basic styling and a JS file adding functionality to the "favourite" buttons.

- Brief explanation of `head` - add title

- Opening/Closing tags

- Semantic HTML and why it's important

- `header` with `h1`

- `nav` > `ul` > `li`

- `main` > first `section` > `p`

- `img` - Placebear link in notes, could use something else

- Sections for posts - `header` and `main` again

- `h2` in header, `h3`, `h4`, `p` with lorem ipsum in post sections

- Copyright notice in `footer` (link in notes)
